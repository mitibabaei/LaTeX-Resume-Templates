**Ensure you compile your document with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. **

**IMPORTANT:** If you receive a warning after uploading LaTeX templates in Overleaf or if your CV creates an extra white page, modify your LaTeX document by switching to XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. 
In Overleaf, you can change the compiler from the menu on the left.
